    "As described in the course, different operating systems use slightly different conventions for describing paths. The most notable differences are that Linux and Mac use `/` as a separator while Windows uses `\\`, and the root directory on Linux and Max is `/`, while the Windows root is (usually) `C:\\`.\n",

    "A second issue is that we have to know where the data is, but if we use an absolute path that is correct on our computer, it will break when moved to a different computer. One way we can try to handle this situation is with *relative paths*, assuming we know the working directory set when the notebook starts up (sometimes this breaks also, especially on remote systems, and some troubleshooting is required). By default, opening a notebook within Jupyter Lab sets that notebook's local as the working dirtectory. "
